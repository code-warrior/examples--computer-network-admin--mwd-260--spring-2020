## (7) Application Layer
* HTTP
* SMTP
* DNS
* FTP

---

## (6) Presentation Layer
* Combined/abstracted in the application layer

---

## (5) Session Layer
* Attempts to maintain a session
* Videoconferencing takes place in this layer
* Lost/broken connections are recovered

---

## (4) Transport Layer
* TCP (born in 1973; made available generally to the public on 1 January 1983; invented by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn)
   + Reliable
   + Ordered
   + Checksums
* UDP, which doesnâ€™t require receipts, like TCP

---

## (3) Network Layer
* IP
* IPv4
   + ~4.3 billion addresses
   + Reaches its limit in Jan/Feb 2011
* IPv6

---

## (2) Data Link Layer
* Exchanges data in adjacent nodes in a WAN on the same LAN

---

## (1) Physical Layer
* WiFi
* Radio waves
* Fiber optic laser pulses
* Copper cables
