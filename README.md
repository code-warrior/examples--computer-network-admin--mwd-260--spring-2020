# Examples and Tutorials for MWD 260, Computer and Network Administration

## In-Class Workflow
For most of the classes that you take with me, the in-class workflow is a variant of the following.

In class, the workflow requires three tools: GitHub Desktop, Atom (or another text editor), and Firefox Developer Edition (or another browser). Launch them in the following order:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Checkout the [examples repo](https://github.com/code-warrior?utf8=✓&tab=repositories&q=examples) for your class from the list of repos on your machine. In macOS, type `⌘ + T`; in Windows, type `Ctrl + T`.
3. Open the examples repo in your editor from GitHub Desktop. In macOS, type `⌘ + ⇧ + A`; in Windows, type `Ctrl + Shift + A`.
4. Launch Firefox Developer Editiion, then drag into the browser any files we’re working with in class. Alternatively, you can drag the examples folder into the browser, then navigate the folder by moving forward/back, like a web site.
